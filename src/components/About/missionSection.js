                    Betelle is a small business certified company headquartered in Maryland. The goal to
                    run an exceptional operation came from our founders, all software
                    engineers in the industry. Noticing a lack of satisfactory delivery, under-funded, rushed,
                    with little opportunities to improve the work, encouraged the conception of Betelle. A technology
                    firm that is founded in doing exceptional work.
                    Our solutions proposes detailed design, structured
                    development and goes through various quality assurance phases
                    before being delivered. <span className={"emphasis"}>We value great work.</span>
