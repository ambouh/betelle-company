# project-betelle

Betelle is a website that advertises products and services for Betelle - A Custom Software Company. 

The website will hold 4 pages:
- homepage
- about
- services
- contact

The technologies used:
- React/JSX: For single page application, and html syntax templating
- React Router: For navigation around the SPA that optimizes page changes and reloads
- SASS/CSS: For styling, to respect the styling practices of CSS while optimizing it by SASS

My goal in this project is to attract users by developing a user-friendly website that has:
- an appealing look-and-feel
- animations that implifies a great experience for this user 
- and does not compromise on the information the company's vision, 
  clearly explains the products and services, to ultimately attract 
  more business leads
